# Cancelled! Dump
This is a dump of the contents of the [Cancelled!](https://cancelled.neocities.org/) website from 2020-09-03, about 12 or so hours before the website was deleted.

The Cancelled! website was active from 2020-09-03 to 2020-09-04, due to that, the site is very small and doesn't have all that much content on it. The best part of the site is by far cancel.html due to how immature it is.
